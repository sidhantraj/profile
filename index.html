          <h3>Microsoft VBA</h3>
          <p>I grew with a big desktop computer at home, where my father used to work with excel. Little bit I knew about Microsoft
            Excel at that time. It was during my bachelors, I realized the power of Excel Macros. I started participating in
            VBA competitions. Several cutting edge technoligies are prevalant however, VBA will still be my favorite.

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>Not much I knew about photography and I am not even skilled enough to consider myself as a professional. However
            ever since I had touched a camera and I started clicking pictures, all I could see is the emotion every picture carry with them.
            A single picture creates a memory is all I can relate too. I was sitting idle one afternoon, I happen to check my phone's gallery
            and I could see a lot of images blurred like by mistake someone has clicked them. Suddenly, I realized that it was clicked with joy
            by my nephew. So, even a blurred photo creates memories.
